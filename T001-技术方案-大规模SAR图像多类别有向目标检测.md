## I. Algorithm Overview (算法概述)

### Goal and Problem Statement

The overall goal of our algorithm is to achieve high-accuracy, efficient detection of multiple classes of oriented objects in large-scale SAR images. SAR images present unique challenges including speckle noise, geometric distortions, complex scattering characteristics, and lack of color information, making traditional object detection methods less effective. Additionally, oriented objects such as ships, aircraft, and vehicles require not only precise localization but also accurate orientation estimation, further increasing the complexity of the task.

### Performance and Application

Our algorithm is designed to achieve state-of-the-art performance metrics including mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, and recall on large-scale SAR datasets like SARDet-100K. The expected application effects include robust detection in complex scenarios with dense target distribution, varying scales, and strong clutter backgrounds. The solution aims to support real-time or near-real-time processing requirements for both military and civilian applications.

### Key Features and Innovation

The key features of our algorithm include: (1) A hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture that combines the powerful local feature extraction capability of CNNs with the global dependency modeling of Transformers; (2) A novel oriented bounding box (OBB) representation and regression strategy specifically designed for SAR target characteristics; (3) Advanced data augmentation techniques tailored for SAR images to enhance model generalization; and (4) An optimized training framework with domain adaptation capabilities to address the challenge of imaging parameter sensitivity.

### Expected Benefits

The practical benefits of our solution include improved detection accuracy and robustness in challenging SAR image scenarios, reduced false alarm rates, and enhanced processing efficiency. The algorithm's domain adaptability enables it to perform well across different SAR sensors, imaging parameters, and geographical regions. Potential application values span military reconnaissance, maritime surveillance, border security, disaster assessment, and resource exploration.

## II. Implementation Plan (实现方案)

### A. Problem-Solving Ideas (解题思路)

#### Understanding and Decomposition

We interpret the challenge of large-scale, multi-class, oriented object detection in SAR images as a combination of three core subproblems: (1) Effective feature extraction in the presence of speckle noise and complex backgrounds; (2) Accurate representation and regression of oriented bounding boxes; and (3) Handling the variability introduced by different imaging parameters and target scales. We decompose the problem into sequential processing stages: data preprocessing and augmentation, feature extraction, multi-scale feature fusion, oriented box prediction, and post-processing.

#### Theoretical Basis

Our approach is built upon several fundamental theories and models: (1) Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for hierarchical feature extraction; (2) Transformer architecture for capturing long-range dependencies and global context; (3) Object detection frameworks including FPN (Feature Pyramid Network) for multi-scale feature fusion and YOLO for one-stage detection efficiency; (4) Rotation-invariant feature learning for handling oriented objects; and (5) Domain adaptation techniques for addressing data distribution shifts.

#### Overall Framework

The overall solution framework consists of the following components: (1) A data processing module for preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization; (2) A backbone network combining CNN (CSPDarknet) and Transformer (Swin Transformer) blocks for feature extraction; (3) A neck module with FPN and PAN (Path Aggregation Network) for multi-scale feature fusion; (4) A detection head specifically designed for oriented bounding box regression and classification; and (5) A post-processing module for non-maximum suppression and confidence filtering.

### B. Data Processing (数据处理)

#### Preprocessing

We apply the following preprocessing steps to the provided SAR image data: (1) Intensity normalization using min-max scaling to standardize pixel values between 0 and 1; (2) Adaptive histogram equalization to enhance contrast in low-contrast regions; (3) Image resizing to a fixed input size (640×640) with aspect ratio preservation; and (4) Radiometric calibration to correct for imaging system variations when metadata is available.

#### Feature Engineering/Extraction

In addition to the deep learning-based automatic feature extraction, we incorporate specific feature engineering techniques for SAR images: (1) Statistical feature extraction including mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis in local image patches; (2) Haralick texture features to capture spatial relationships in SAR images; and (3) Polarimetric feature extraction when multi-polarization data is available, such as Pauli decomposition components.

#### Data Augmentation

Our data augmentation strategies are specifically designed for SAR images and oriented objects: (1) Geometric transformations including random rotation (0-360 degrees), scaling (0.5-1.5x), flipping, and shearing to enhance model robustness to orientation changes; (2) Large Scale Jitter (LSJ) to handle significant scale variations; (3) Speckle noise augmentation to simulate different imaging conditions; (4) Contrast adjustment to simulate varying radiometric conditions; and (5) Mosaic augmentation combining multiple images to improve detection of small objects and dense scenarios.

#### Data Cleaning

We perform the following data cleaning and filtering operations: (1) Removal of low-quality images with extreme speckle noise or severe geometric distortions; (2) Filtering of annotation outliers with unrealistic bounding box dimensions or orientations; (3) Duplicate removal to ensure dataset diversity; and (4) Balancing of class distribution through oversampling of underrepresented classes and strategic sampling of majority classes.

### C. Algorithm Design and Development (算法设计与开发)

#### Model Type

We employ a one-stage, anchor-free detection model architecture that integrates elements from both CNN and Transformer-based approaches. The model consists of a hybrid backbone (CSPDarknet + Swin Transformer), an FPN-PAN neck for multi-scale feature fusion, and a custom detection head for oriented bounding box prediction.

#### Core Modules

The key modules of our algorithm include:

1. **Hybrid Backbone**: The backbone network combines CSPDarknet blocks for local feature extraction and Swin Transformer blocks for global context modeling. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both paradigms for SAR image feature representation.

2. **Oriented Detection Head**: Our custom detection head is specifically designed for oriented bounding box regression. It uses a novel angle representation that avoids boundary discontinuities and employs a dedicated regression branch for angle prediction along with classification and box regression branches.

3. **Attention Mechanisms**: We incorporate both channel and spatial attention mechanisms at multiple levels of the network to enhance feature representation of SAR targets and suppress background clutter.

4. **Multi-scale Feature Fusion**: The FPN-PAN neck efficiently fuses features from different scales, enabling effective detection of both large and small objects in SAR images.

#### Implementation Logic

The step-by-step implementation logic of our algorithm is as follows:

1. Input SAR images are preprocessed and augmented according to the strategies described in Section B.

2. The hybrid backbone extracts hierarchical feature representations from the input images.

3. The FPN-PAN neck fuses features from different scales to create a rich feature pyramid.

4. The oriented detection head processes the fused features to predict classification scores, bounding box coordinates, and orientations for potential objects.

5. A rotated non-maximum suppression (RNMS) algorithm is applied to filter redundant detections and produce the final results.

6. Confidence thresholding is used to select high-confidence detections for output.

### D. Model Training and Optimization (模型训练与优化)

#### Training Strategy

Our overall model training strategy follows a multi-stage approach: (1) Pre-training on a large-scale dataset (SARDet-100K) to learn general SAR image features; (2) Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets to adapt to specific application requirements; and (3) Domain adaptation training to enhance generalization across different imaging conditions.

#### Loss Function

We use a multi-task loss function that combines:

1. **Classification Loss**: Focal loss to address class imbalance and focus training on hard examples.

2. **Regression Loss**: A combination of smooth L1 loss for box coordinates and a novel angle loss that addresses the circular nature of orientation (using sine and cosine representations to avoid boundary discontinuities).

3. **IoU Loss**: GIoU (Generalized Intersection over Union) loss to directly optimize the IoU metric and improve localization accuracy.

#### Optimizer and Scheduler

We employ the AdamW optimizer with weight decay for training, which has shown superior performance in deep learning models compared to traditional SGD. For learning rate scheduling, we use a cosine annealing schedule with warmup, which gradually increases the learning rate during the initial epochs and then decreases it following a cosine curve.

#### Hyperparameter Tuning

We use a combination of grid search and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. Key hyperparameters tuned include: (1) Learning rate (initial range: 0.0001-0.01); (2) Batch size (8-32, depending on GPU memory); (3) Weight decay (0.0001-0.001); (4) Confidence threshold (0.2-0.5); and (5) IoU threshold for non-maximum suppression (0.4-0.6).

#### Regularization/Validation

To prevent overfitting and ensure model generalization, we implement several regularization techniques: (1) Dropout with a rate of 0.2 in the Transformer blocks; (2) Weight decay to penalize large weights; (3) Data augmentation as described in Section B; and (4) Early stopping based on validation performance. For cross-validation, we use 5-fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness of our results.

#### Optimization Details

We implement several specific optimizations to improve algorithm performance, efficiency, and robustness:

1. **Mixed Precision Training**: Using FP16 precision for faster training and reduced memory usage.

2. **Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring knowledge from a larger, more accurate teacher model to a smaller, more efficient student model.

3. **Pruning and Quantization**: Applying model pruning and quantization techniques to reduce inference time and model size for deployment on edge devices.

4. **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)**: Using multiple augmentations during inference and averaging results to improve detection accuracy.

### E. Testing and Validation (测试与验证)

#### Evaluation Metrics

We use the following specific evaluation metrics to verify our algorithm's effectiveness and performance:

1. **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**: Calculated at different IoU thresholds (0.5, 0.75, and averaged across 0.5-0.95) to measure overall detection accuracy.

2. **Precision-Recall Curve**: To visualize the trade-off between precision and recall.

3. **False Alarm Rate (FAR)**: To measure the number of false detections per unit area.

4. **Processing Speed**: Measured in frames per second (FPS) to evaluate inference efficiency.

5. **Robustness Metrics**: Performance degradation under varying imaging conditions, speckle noise levels, and target scales.

#### Experimentation

Our testing methods include:

1. **Ablation Studies**: We conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component of our algorithm, including the hybrid backbone, attention mechanisms, oriented detection head, and data augmentation strategies.

2. **Comparative Experiments**: We compare our algorithm against several baseline models including Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5, DETR, and MA-DETR on standard SAR datasets. The comparison focuses on detection accuracy, processing speed, and robustness to challenging conditions.

3. **Cross-Domain Testing**: We evaluate our algorithm's performance on data from different sensors and geographical regions to test its generalization capability.

4. **Real-world Validation**: We validate our algorithm on real-world SAR image data with ground truth annotations to ensure its practical applicability.
